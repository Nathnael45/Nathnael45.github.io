name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'  # Specify your Node version

      # Step 3: Install Yarn
      - name: Install Yarn
        run: npm install -g yarn

      # Step 4: Install dependencies via Yarn
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      # Step 5: Run yarn dev (typically used for development, so this will not be part of the deploy, but could be part of a test)
      - name: Run yarn dev
        run: yarn dev  # This command starts your development server

      # Step 6: Build the project (replace `yarn build` with your actual build command)
      - name: Build project
        run: yarn build

      # Step 7: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
